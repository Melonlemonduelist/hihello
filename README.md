# Zoe Ames Portfolio

Welcome! I'm **Zoe Ames**. This summer, I'm part of the Summer Youth Employment Program, where I'm learning full stack web development and game development. I'm also helping other students learn these skills along the way!

In addition to coding, I love drawingâ€”both digitally and traditionally. This site is a showcase of my journey as a developer, mentor, and artist.
